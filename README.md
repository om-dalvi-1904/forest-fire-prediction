# Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) Prediction Web App

This is a Flask-based web application that predicts the Fire Weather Index (FWI) using a trained Ridge Regression model. The model uses weather and environmental parameters to make the prediction.

## 🚀 Running the App
1. Ensure the following files exist inside the models/ directory: ridge.pkl, scaler.pkl

2. Start the Flask application: 
```bash
python application.py
```

3. Open a browser and go to: 
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:5000/predictdata
```

3. Open a browser and go to: ```http://127.0.0.1:5000/predictdata```
    This will load the input form for prediction.

## 🧠 Model Inputs
The form accepts the following 11 numerical inputs:

1. Temperature

2. RH (Relative Humidity)

3. Ws (Wind Speed)

4. Rain

5. FFMC (Fine Fuel Moisture Code)

6. DMC (Duff Moisture Code)

7. ISI (Initial Spread Index)

8. Classes (Fire class encoding)

9. Region (Region code)

Make sure all fields are filled with valid numbers before submitting.

## 🔧 Error Handling
If any field is left blank or has non-numeric input, the application will return an error.

Server-side validation is included to help catch input issues.

## 💡 Notes
1. A GET request to /predictdata loads the input form (home.html).

2. A POST request processes the form data, makes the prediction, and returns the result in the same template.
